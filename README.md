## About

__This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).__
- Heartlink is **an addressbook** created to cater to the needs of **Social Workers in Singapore**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - **Adding** a new client's information
  - **Viewing** clients' contact information
  - **Editing** a client's information
  - **Deleting** a client's information
  - **Linking** an appointment to a client
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Heartlink_) used for managing contact details for social workers.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- It is named `HeartLink` because it can help to link the needy with social workers more seamlessly.
